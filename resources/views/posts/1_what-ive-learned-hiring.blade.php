What I learned hiring other developers.

I work at a newborn startup, and only people that had work at a newborn startup really knows what is like it. You become basically 
a fullstack employee, fullfiling the work of designers, tech leaders and even doing HR stuff. I already worked on hiring 3 other devs and I learn
a lot of stuff from it. Here's what I got.

<h3>GitHub is one of the most important tool that a Developer can use</h3>
<p>In the initial days most developers ignore the use of GitHub. They think that just because they don't have something "cool" to 
    show it they just don't need to show something, that's completely wrong. When I did the pre-selection of the candidates I often 
    prefered a dev that did have a populated GitHub, but that didn't have any previous experience than a dev with previous experiences but 
    no content at their GitHub. When I see someone with an organized, well-documented GitHub I can tell with a few seconds what the person is and isn't capable of, 
    when a candidate don't have a good GitHub I really can't tell what are the capabilities of the person. Of course that people lie 
    and the GitHub/GitLab can't serve as a proof of capability, but it can be a great indicator.  
</p>
<h3>Work your social skills</h3>
<p>People at the technology area can be very awkward and that's okay! But you will need to know how to comunicate, when you stays too quiet 
    at an interview you pass the look of "do not care" type of person, and unless you are a kind of genius that will probably cut you from the 
    job chance really sooner that expected, smile and show interest at the job you are applying for.
</p>
<h3>Know what are you doing but don't be afraid of</h3>
<p>Being ready is really different of knowing what you will need to do everyday. The problem with most developers is that they know what they "need" to know but they 
    are not prepared to face something that they don't know yet, doesn't mean that if you just ended a Z tech course you will get the job, what make a good dev a GREAT dev is not 
    what they know now, it is what they can know. We dev's can know everything, but still some of us limit themselves to only knowing X and doing Y, more important that 
    knowing what you need to know to pass a job interview is know that you will need to learn some new things.
