What I learned hiring other developers.

I work at a newborn startup, and only people who have worked at a newborn startup really know what it's like it. You basically become a fullstack employee, filling in for designers, tech leads, and even doing HR. I have already worked on hiring 3 other developers and learned a lot along the way. Here is what I learned.

<h3>GitHub is one of the most important tool that a Developer can use</h3>
<p>In the early days, most developers ignore using GitHub. They think that just because they do not have anything "cool" to show, they do not have to show anything, but that's completely wrong. When I was shortlisting candidates, I would often choose a developer who had a populated GitHub but no previous experience over a developer with previous experience but no content on their GitHub. When I see someone with a well- organized, well-documented GitHub, I can tell within seconds what the person can and cannot do. If a candidate does not have a good GitHub, I can not assess the person's skills. Of course, people lie and GitHub/GitLab cannot serve as a proof of skills, but it can be a good indicator.
</p>
<h3>Work your social skills</h3>
<p>People in the technology field can be very awkward and that's okay! But you will need to know how to communicate. If you stays too quiet during an interview, you'll come across as a person who does not care, and unless you are a genius, you'll probably be eliminated from the job opportunity sooner than expected.
</p>
<h3>Know what are you doing but don't be afraid of the need to learn new thing</h3>
<p>Being ready is very different than knowing what you need to do every day. The problem with most developers is that they know what they "need" to know, but they are not prepared to deal with something they do not yet know. That does not mean you'll get the job if you just finished a Tech course. What makes a good developer a GREAT developer is not what they know now, but what they can know. We developers can know everything, but still some of us limit themselves to only knowing X and doing Y. More important than knowing what you need to know to pass an interview is knowing that you need to learn new things.
