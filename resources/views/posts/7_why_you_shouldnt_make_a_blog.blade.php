        For a long, long time creating a blog while being a developer was a big deal, as programmers we always want to
        keep reading, learning, and writing about what we learned. Besides being a great side project to keep, a great
        way to indulge yourself in writing more is developing your website, writing your articles, and publishing them
        on it, but as time passed the way media and knowledge were shared changed and nowadays we have better ways of
        writing and reading articles.

    </p>
    <p>Tech blogs emerged with the fever of blogs during the 2000s, besides the expected news-like blogs we had a
        growing number of personal
        ones, where developers shared their own experiences and thoughts on a variety of subjects in the area, this one
        left a big impact on the industry because
        it was an easy way of having a voice and sharing your own
        articles and opening discussions without having to go through a big media group. The discussions that were
        usually reserved for the
        top-notch programmers in big forums and events now were open to the public and a huge range of programmers now
        could be listened to easily.</p>

    <p>
        Blogs are still great but the problem with them nowadays is that with the evolution of the internet, information
        and entertainment are
        bloated, infinite-scrolling entertainment it is at its peak form and the majority of us don't have the patience
        anymore to keep up with a dozen of blogs and writers as we used to do during the 2000s, the truth is that even
        the blog format evolved and now we have platforms like
        medium, dev.to, Reddit and other that still holds what was the most essential in blogging but centralizing it in
        one place. Now, in just one platform
        we have access to a dozen articles of a dozen writers having the possibility to be part of this group. The
        discussion aspect is
        even more relevant nowadays and the writing and sharing of your article is easier than ever, even with the
        downfall of blogging it seems that
        learning in public is at its peak of popularity.

        You shouldn't make a blog, you should instead create an account at Tabnews, at dev.to, and other alikes, I know
        that having your blog has a lot of glamour and pride, but we must use the better tools and these
        websites are one of the greatest options that we have. Based on this, this is probably my last post on this
        blog, it helped me a LOT with my writing but I know that sometimes we need to make the next step, I want to do
        more educational posts meaning I want they to reach the maximum number of people possible, and for that, I would
        probably need to migrate to bigger platforms. I will link my profiles below and I'm thankful for everyone who
        read this blog.
