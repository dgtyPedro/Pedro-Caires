    My next step as a developer

    Hello, I'm Pedro and today I'm going to be telling you a little about a feeling that has been haunting me for a while.
    I currently work as a Fullstack Web Developer in an IT solutions startup, I had a noticeable growth in my first months and quickly
    I earned my place in the company. When I joined, it had just been created and that culminated in me, a Junior dev at the time, receiving
    big responsibilities/tasks. When this situation occurs either the developer can't handle the pressure and ends up being shut down or he
    holds the stride and gains a prominent position in this company, this last case is what happened to me, I don't think I made it
    because I am necessarily a genius and yes because I have an ability to learn things in the "heat of the moment". Thereby
    I received a certain amount of prestige within the company and started to run projects on my own, I have the flexibility to do whatever I want
    whenever I want and I have the comfort of knowing that everything is within my control, I felt for a moment that the worst in the process of becoming a developer was over.
    I believe that this is the story of many developers and that most of them, like me, go through this situation.

<h2>The situation</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 5vw;">As much as programming is an area
    highly sought after these days it gets harder and harder to get a job opportunity at first,
    competition is extremely high for these Junior level positions and gone are the days when a
    certificate and willingness to learn was enough, to get into the game many hours of study and projects go by, I went through it and I know that
    when we got the first opportunity; the first contract; the first payday; we developers were ecstatic. Now the part
    more difficult than it was to get an opportunity and keep it, it's gone, we've already proved ourselves and we have to worry about "only"
    in working and showing service, at least that's what we think, and that's where a big trap that many fall into.
    Stagnation for comfort.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 5vw;">The comfort I felt for a few months was unbelievable, because I learned so quickly I could easily deliver everything that was passed on to me, there were countless
    the days that after 1:30h ~ 2h of work I had finished all my tasks and could switch off, the salary always fell on the right day and for not being responsible for anyone
    after the bills were paid, there was a good amount left over to have fun. It was and is a great life, you'll never see me complain about anything on this blog, I'm a privileged person
    for having everything and everyone that I have, it's surreal to see so many amazing people being fired from other companies while many times I got paid for doing a job
    average, I believe that this feeling of comfort turned into anguish over time and made me reflect on the moment that was inserted.
    I was hallucinated by my technology for a long time and closed myself to other opportunities; I received many compliments and I stopped studying because
    "I've had enough"; I achieved what I understood as stagnation through comfort.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 5vw;">
    Não podemos confundir essa zona de conforto com estabilidade, acredito que todos almejam a estabilidade mas o que ocorreu comigo
    foi uma grande decaída na minha curva de aprendizado, aprendi "tudo" que era requisitado no meu trabalho e fiquei por aí, eu ainda aprendia algo novo sempre que começava
um novo projeto, cada deploy me ensinava algo de diferente e todo projeto entregue me trazia experiência, porém nesses últimos meses
senti que eu não estava realmente sendo desafiado, comecei a ficar insatisfeito com o meu código, comecei a dúvidar do meu próprio cargo e seu merecimento,
a síndrome do impostor é algo que provavelmente todo desenvolvedor vai sentir, mesmo que em situações diferentes, e nesse momento temos a opção de deixar o conforto (e ansiedade em alguns casos) nos engolir
ou partir para a próxima.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>My next step</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 5vw;">We cannot confuse this comfort zone with stability, I believe that everyone wants stability, but what happened to me
    it was a big drop in my learning curve, I learned "everything" that was required in my job and that was it, I still learned something new every time I started
    a new project, each deployment taught me something different and every project delivered brought me to experience, but in these last few months
    I felt that I wasn't really being challenged, I started to become dissatisfied with my code, I started to doubt my own position and its worthiness,
    imposter syndrome is something that probably every developer will feel, even if in different situations, and at that moment we have the option of letting comfort (and anxiety in some cases) swallow us
    or move on to the next one.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 5vw;">Everything I said here could be a lot of bullshit, I defined it as an article but it's nothing more than a page in a developer's diary, but I believe
    that that's the point. In this first week of June 2022, I will be starting the process of resigning from my current company and will start looking for a new opportunity, I hope that everything works out for me and that it works for you, reader.<br/>
    I hope you enjoyed it and see you soon!
